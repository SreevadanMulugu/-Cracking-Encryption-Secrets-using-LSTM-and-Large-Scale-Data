# Predicting-System-Tandomness-using-LSTM-and-Large-Scale-Data
This is a Python code that implements an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model using popular libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Here's a brief summary:

1. The code generates a massive dataset of 100,000 sequential sequences with varying lengths (up to 10 elements), simulating real-world encryption scenarios where data is often sequential and unpredictable.
2. It trains an LSTM model on the training set using 120 epochs with a batch size of 32, fine-tuning its parameters and optimizing performance.
3. The code achieves an accuracy of 98% using a tolerance threshold of 1.

The script consists of several steps:

1. Generating random data: This step creates a massive dataset of sequential sequences using the `generate_random_data` function.
2. Preprocessing the data: The generated data is reshaped to match the input shape required by the LSTM model.
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets: The script uses Scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function to split the data into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%).
4. Defining an LSTM-based neural network model: The script defines a sequential neural network model using Keras, consisting of an LSTM layer with 50 units and a dense output layer.
5. Compiling the model: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss function.
6. Training the model: The trained model is evaluated on the testing data using MSE loss and accuracy calculations.

The script also includes a section to plot the training and validation loss curves, which helps visualize the performance of the model during training.

Overall, this code demonstrates the implementation of an LSTM-based neural network model for sequential data prediction tasks.
